Download data from open street map's overpass api:
	Overpass API https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API
	Openstreet map https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=toronto#map=11/43.6542/-79.3872
	
	At this point you suppose to have a osm file
	
Then use overpass turbo to convert the map data from OSM to geoJson:
	overpass turbo/osmtogeojson: 
		https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojson
		https://overpass-turbo.eu/ (this link only work for small data testing purpose only)

Now you suppose to have a geojson data file can be found in here(size reduced due to github limit include only scarbrough)
	https://github.com/UTSCC09/project-nogooglemap/blob/master/routes_finding/DATA/export.geojson

Use geoJson.io to check and trim the data
	http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0
	
We use postgresql to store all of our data
	https://www.postgresql.org/

Use gdal-bin to import the geojson file into postgresql
	https://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html

Use pgrouting to anaylis the data(ganerate node and edges) and provids calculation result
	https://pgrouting.org/

Use geoserver to host that map view(who handle request, perform query and send result)
	http://geoserver.org/
	
The geoserver is hosted by TomCat
	http://tomcat.apache.org/
